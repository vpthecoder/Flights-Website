RUby is a completely object oriented programming langauge while php has some features that
are not object oriented. PHP runs on the web server while you would need to use a framwork
such as Ruby on Rails to run Ruby. Testing is easier in Ruby since everything is object-oriented so 
it can reduce the time for deployment compared to php. PHP was created specifically for the web
while Ruby is a genral purpose object-oriented language. PHP has a wider developer community and runs more sites
on the web as of right now. PHP can be harder to maintain due to the fact that it is weakly typed and can lead to
some ugly code. Ruby is much more scalable than PHP and big programs written in RUby are easily maintainable. 
Since it is a general-purpose lanaguage, Ruby can do a little more than PHP, which is only a scripting language.
